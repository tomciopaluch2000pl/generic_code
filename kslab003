Step 3 — Insert baseline rows into each tablespace

3.1 Connect

db2 connect to KSLAB1

3.2 Insert rows (one line each)

db2 "INSERT INTO T_TS1 (ID,VAL,TS) VALUES (1,'ts1_row1_base',CURRENT TIMESTAMP)"
db2 "INSERT INTO T_TS1 (ID,VAL,TS) VALUES (2,'ts1_row2_base',CURRENT TIMESTAMP)"

db2 "INSERT INTO T_TS2 (ID,VAL,TS) VALUES (10,'ts2_row10_base',CURRENT TIMESTAMP)"
db2 "INSERT INTO T_TS2 (ID,VAL,TS) VALUES (11,'ts2_row11_base',CURRENT TIMESTAMP)"

db2 "INSERT INTO T_TS3 (ID,VAL,TS) VALUES (20,'ts3_row20_base',CURRENT TIMESTAMP)"
db2 "INSERT INTO T_TS3 (ID,VAL,TS) VALUES (21,'ts3_row21_base',CURRENT TIMESTAMP)"

db2 "COMMIT"

3.3 Verify counts + show rows (quick evidence)

db2 "SELECT 'TS1' AS TS, COUNT(*) AS CNT FROM T_TS1"
db2 "SELECT 'TS2' AS TS, COUNT(*) AS CNT FROM T_TS2"
db2 "SELECT 'TS3' AS TS, COUNT(*) AS CNT FROM T_TS3"

db2 "SELECT * FROM T_TS2 ORDER BY ID"

3.4 Disconnect

db2 connect reset

Then we go straight to Step 4: ONLINE FULL backup (performance + INCLUDE LOGS) using your /ars/home/kslab/backup/full/tgt1,tgt2 targets.
