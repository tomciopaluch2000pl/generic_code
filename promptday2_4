Using the meeting minutes provided as input, identify any inconsistencies. Focus ONLY on the following three types of issues:

1. Action points assigned to people who are marked as "Excused".
2. Action points with due dates that are earlier than the meeting date.
3. Action points that clearly contradict the current context (for example, asking someone to allocate budget while the budget is frozen).

Then, produce the output in exactly one of the formats below:

A) If you find at least one inconsistency:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <write the first inconsistency as one short, factual, natural sentence>
- <write the second inconsistency as one short, factual, natural sentence>
(Continue bullets only if there are more clear inconsistencies of the three types above.)

B) If you do NOT find any inconsistencies of these three types:
No problems found.

Formatting and content rules:
- Do not add any other headings, explanations, or commentary before or after the answer.
- Use exactly the sentence "Potential problems in the meeting minutes:" when you list issues.
- Start each issue on a new line beginning with "- ".
- Keep each bullet short, factual, and businesslike, similar in style and length to the acceptable responses.
- Do NOT invent additional problems beyond the three categories listed above.
- Do NOT rephrase the formats A) or B); use them exactly as specified.
- Write each inconsistency as a complete, natural English sentence (not a label, not shorthand).
