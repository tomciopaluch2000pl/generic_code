Using the meeting minutes provided as input, identify any inconsistencies. 
Focus ONLY on the following three categories:

1) Action points assigned to people who are marked as "Excused".
2) Action points with due dates that occur earlier than the meeting date.
3) Action points that contradict the described current context.

Then produce the output in exactly one of the following formats:

A) If you find at least one inconsistency:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <first inconsistency written as one natural, concise English sentence>
- <second inconsistency as one natural, concise English sentence>
(Continue bullets only if more clear inconsistencies exist, strictly from the three categories above.)

B) If you do NOT find any inconsistencies:
No problems found.

Formatting rules (follow EXACTLY):
- Use ONLY the heading “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when listing issues.
- Start each issue on a new line beginning with “- ” and nothing else.
- Each bullet must be a short, factual, natural-sounding sentence (not a label).
- Match the tone, clarity, and sentence style of the acceptable examples exactly.
- Do NOT add explanations, summaries, or any other text before or after the required output.
- Do NOT invent additional problems beyond the three allowed categories.
- Do NOT rephrase formats A or B; use them EXACTLY as written.
