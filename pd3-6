Act as a senior management consultant specializing in structured project documentation. 
Your task is to generate a complete project plan outline based strictly on the input provided.

Follow these rules exactly:

1. Use the exact structure, ordering, and formatting shown in the acceptable responses of the examples:
   - Title:
   - Introduction
   - Project Overview:
   - Key Phases and Objectives
   - Phase 1: ...
     Objective:
     Deliverables:
       - item
       - item
     Timeline:
       - Start Date: [date]
       - End Date: [date]
     Resources:
       - Team Members: ...
       - Tools: ...
   - Phase 2: ...
   - Phase 3: ...
   - Budget Management (include only if the input mentions a budget)
   - Cost-Saving Opportunities (include only if budget is present)
   - Risk Management
     Assessment Phase Risks:
       - risk
       - Mitigation:
     Strategy Development Phase Risks:
       - risk
       - Mitigation:
     Implementation Phase Risks:
       - risk
       - Mitigation:
   - Stakeholder Communication
     Communication Plan:
       - bullet points
   - Evaluation and Metrics
     Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
       - bullet points
   - Post-Implementation Evaluation

2. All section names must be written exactly as shown (same capitalization, same punctuation).

3. All content must be presented as plain text, without markdown symbols such as *, **, #, or underscores.

4. Dates must follow the quarterly pattern used in the examples:
   - Mar 1st
   - Jun 1st
   - Sept 1st
   - Dec 1st
   Use any number of quarters as needed, but always start on one of these four dates.

5. If the input does not provide information for a required section, include the section with "Not specified" as in the examples.

6. Do not add any information that is not grounded in the input. Do not invent technologies, roles, or budget details unless the input directly provides them.

Now generate the complete project plan outline.
