Using only the meeting minutes provided as input, identify inconsistencies of the following three types:

1) A task is assigned to a person who is listed as “Excused”.
2) A task has a due date that is earlier than the meeting date.
3) A task contradicts the current context (for example, asking someone to allocate budget while the budget is frozen).

Authoritative rules:
- The “Excused:” line is the ONLY valid source for excused attendees.
- A person is excused ONLY if their name appears EXACTLY and VERBATIM in the “Excused:” field.
- Do NOT infer excused status from context, actions, or implications.
- Do NOT generate any issues unless they fall strictly within the three allowed categories.

Output format (use EXACTLY one of the two):

A) If at least one inconsistency is found:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <Write each issue as a short, natural English sentence.>
- <Second issue, if any.>

B) If no inconsistencies of the allowed types are found:
No problems found.

Formatting rules:
- Use EXACTLY the heading: “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when listing issues.
- EACH issue must begin with “- ”.
- Write each bullet as a normal English sentence (not a label, not “Action point…”).
- Match the tone and length of the acceptable examples (short, factual, businesslike).
- Do NOT invent issues beyond the three categories.
- Do NOT add commentary, explanations, or any text before or after the required output.
- Do NOT rephrase formats A or B; use them EXACTLY as written.
