- Do NOT omit required sections.  
- Maintain EXACT spacing and formatting.  
- Use clear, meaningful, concise bullets (not too short like 2–3 words, not full sentences).

- Constraints
- Background descriptive text

If included, Introduction MUST contain:

Project Overview: [one clear sentence summarizing the project]

If the INPUT does NOT provide contextual elements → OMIT the entire Introduction section.

CORE STRUCTURE (ALWAYS REQUIRED)
------------------------------------------------------------

After optional Introduction, always include:

Key Phases and Objectives

Then generate each phase listed in the INPUT.

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE FORMAT (STRICT)
------------------------------------------------------------

Each phase must follow EXACT spacing:
