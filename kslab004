Step 4 — ONLINE FULL Backup (Production-Style)

Now we simulate how you would do this in a serious environment.

We will:
	•	Use multiple targets (parallelism)
	•	Use BUFFER
	•	Use PARALLELISM
	•	Use INCLUDE LOGS
	•	Use COMPRESS

⸻

Step 4.1 — Connect

db2 connect to KSLAB1

Step 4.2 — ONLINE FULL Backup (performance tuned)

Single line:

db2 "BACKUP DATABASE KSLAB1 ONLINE TO '/ars/home/kslab/backup/full/tgt1','/ars/home/kslab/backup/full/tgt2' WITH 2 BUFFER 1024 INCLUDE LOGS COMPRESS"
Explanation:
	•	ONLINE → database stays available
	•	INCLUDE LOGS → required for PIT rollforward without hunting archive logs
	•	PARALLELISM 2 → two data streams (lab small, prod much higher)
	•	BUFFER 1024 → better throughput
	•	COMPRESS → realistic production setting

⸻

Step 4.3 — Verify backup image

After success, run:

db2 list history backup all for KSLAB1

We need:
	•	Backup timestamp
	•	Type = F
	•	Online = Y
