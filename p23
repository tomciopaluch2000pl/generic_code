Using only the meeting minutes provided as input, identify inconsistencies restricted to the following three categories:

1. Tasks assigned to people who are marked as “Excused”.
2. Tasks with due dates earlier than the meeting date.
3. Tasks that contradict the stated current context (e.g., asking someone to allocate budget when the budget is frozen).

Authoritative rules:
- The “Excused:” line is the only valid source of excused attendees.
- A person is excused only if their name appears exactly and verbatim in that line.
- Do not infer excused status from task content or context.
- Do not report issues outside the three allowed categories.

Language rules:
- Do NOT use phrases such as “Action point”, “Action points”, “Action item”, “Task assignment”, “The action for…”, or any similar label.
- Each bullet must be a short, natural, factual English sentence, written the same way as the acceptable example responses on the platform.

Output format — use exactly one option:

A) If at least one inconsistency is found:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <Short, natural English sentence describing the first inconsistency.>
- <Second inconsistency if applicable.>
(Include bullets only for issues clearly matching the three allowed categories.)

B) If no inconsistencies of the allowed types are found:
No problems found.

Formatting rules:
- Use exactly the heading “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when listing issues.
- Each issue must begin with “- ”.
- Do not add commentary, explanations, or extra text before or after the required output.
- Do not rephrase formats A or B; use them exactly as written.
