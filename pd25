Using the meeting minutes provided as input, identify any inconsistencies.

Evaluate ONLY the following three categories:
1) Actions assigned to people who are marked as “Excused”.
2) Actions with due dates earlier than the meeting date.
3) Actions that contradict the stated context (e.g., allocating budget while the budget is frozen).

Authoritative rules:
- Treat ONLY the “Excused:” line as the definitive list of excused attendees.
- A person is excused ONLY if their name appears EXACTLY and VERBATIM in that line.
- Do NOT assume or infer excused status from any other text.
- Do NOT generate an excused-related issue unless it strictly follows the above rule.

Output format — use EXACTLY one:

A) If at least one inconsistency exists:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <A short, natural English sentence describing the first inconsistency.>
- <A short, natural English sentence describing the second inconsistency.>
(Continue only if more issues clearly fall within the three allowed categories.)

B) If no inconsistencies exist:
No problems found.

Style and formatting rules:
- Use EXACTLY the heading “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when listing issues.
- Begin each issue with “- ”.
- Write each bullet as a natural, concise English sentence referring to the specific person and action (e.g., “Tom is excused but is assigned to freeze new allocations.”).
- Do NOT start bullets with phrases like “A task…” or “An action point…”.
- Match the tone and brevity of the acceptable responses (short, factual, businesslike).
- Do NOT add commentary, labels, summaries, or any text before or after the required output.
- Do NOT invent issues outside the three categories.
- Do NOT rephrase formats A or B; use them exactly.
