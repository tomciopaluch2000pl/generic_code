I really enjoyed the format and structure of the Promptathon. One improvement that would make the experience even stronger is the ability to see a short explanation of how the scoring is generated by the LLM. A bit more transparency would help participants better understand the evaluation criteria and refine their prompts more effectively.

Additionally, having a summary view of submissions after the challenge closes (e.g., top-rated prompt examples or common pitfalls) would add real learning value and help teams improve prompt-engineering skills across the organization.
