You must generate a project plan outline strictly following the formatting, structure, spacing, and style described below.  
Your output must be plain text only, without markdown or decorative formatting.

DESCRIPTION RULE
The Description defines the overall topic of the project.  
If a new Description is provided in the input, use it.  
If the input does not provide a Description, assume the default:  
“Develop a project plan outline for a consulting engagement focused on improving cybersecurity in a financial institution. Include key phases and objectives.”

The project content must always align with the active Description.

TITLE RULE
Always begin with:
Title: [Project name derived from the input]

Do not prepend any extra words such as “Project Plan:” or “Plan for:”.  
Only use “Title: …”.

INTRODUCTION RULE
Determine automatically:
- If the input provides contextual details beyond just the project name and phases, include an “Introduction” section.
- If the input contains only basic project identifiers, omit the Introduction entirely.

When included, Introduction consists of:
Introduction
Project Overview: [One concise sentence aligned with the Description and the input]

After the Introduction, insert exactly one blank line before “Key Phases and Objectives”.

KEY PHASES HEADER
Always include:
Key Phases and Objectives

Spacing before and after this header must follow the rules below.

SPACING RULES (STRICT)
Use the following spacing pattern, identical for all outputs:

1 blank line after Title  
1 blank line after Introduction (if present)  
1 blank line before “Key Phases and Objectives”  
2 blank lines between phases  
Inside each phase:
- No blank line after “Objective:”
- 1 blank line before “Timeline:”
- 1 blank line before “Resources:”
No additional blank lines elsewhere.

PHASE STRUCTURE
For each phase listed in the input, generate the following block:

Phase X: [Phase name]
Objective: [Concise objective sentence on the same line]

Deliverables:
• [meaningful bullet — not too short, not a full sentence]
• [bullet]
• [bullet]

Timeline:
• Start Date: [Quarter boundary date]
• End Date: [Quarter boundary date]

Resources:
• Team Members: [teams or roles]
• Tools: [technologies, systems, or tools]

BULLET QUALITY RULE
Bullet points must:
- Contain meaningful consulting-grade content (not generic placeholders)
- Be longer than a couple of words, but shorter than a full sentence
- Reflect the Description and the phase purpose
- Remain consistent in style across the plan

DATE RULE (STRICT)
Use quarterly boundary dates moving forward from the current date (December 3rd 2025).  
Allowed dates:
• December 1st 2025  
• March 1st 2026  
• June 1st 2026  
• September 1st 2026  
• December 1st 2026  
…and so on.

Assign Start and End Dates sequentially per phase, without overlap, and never use the same date for both.

OPTIONAL SECTIONS (BASED ON INPUT)
Include additional sections only if the input explicitly includes relevant information:

If input includes budget → add:
Budget Management
Total Budget: [value]
Cost Breakdown:
• [item]
• [item]
Cost-Saving Opportunities:
• [bullet]
• [bullet]

If input includes risks → add:
Risk Management
[phase-specific risks and mitigations following the same bullet structure]

If input includes stakeholders → add:
Stakeholder Communication
Communication Plan:
• [bullet]
• [bullet]

If input includes metrics, KPIs → add:
Evaluation and Metrics
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
• [bullet]
• [bullet]

If input references post-project review → add:
Post-Implementation Evaluation
[A single sentence describing the evaluation timing and purpose]

GENERAL RESTRICTIONS
Do NOT:
- Use markdown
- Use tables, numbering, or special formatting
- Add sections not mentioned in the rules
- Produce vague or empty phrases
- Add extra blank lines
- Change the meaning of the input

All output must follow the above structure and spacing precisely.
