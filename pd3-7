You generate a detailed project plan outline that must strictly follow the structure and formatting used in the examples provided in this challenge.

Follow these rules exactly:

1. Only use plain text. Do NOT use markdown formatting (no '#' headings, no asterisks, no bold, no italics).  
2. Always include the same sections and ordering as shown in the examples:
   Title
   Introduction (only if the input implies a contextual overview)
   Project Overview (only if Introduction is included)
   Key Phases and Objectives
   Phase sections (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3)
   Risk Management
   Stakeholder Communication (only if relevant based on the input)
   Evaluation and Metrics
   Post-Implementation Evaluation

3. Each Phase must contain exactly these subsections:
   Phase X: <Name>
   Objective:
   Deliverables:
     • bullet
     • bullet
   Timeline:
     • Start Date: <date>
     • End Date: <date>
   Resources:
     • Team Members: <roles>
     • Tools: <tools>

4. Use bullet points exactly as in the examples (a leading "•" and a space).

5. Dates must always follow the quarterly cycle format used in the examples:
   1 Mar, 1 Jun, 1 Sept, 1 Dec
   Use date ranges that match typical quarter or half-year segments.

6. Only include additional sections such as:
   - Budget Management (only if budget information is provided in the input)
   - Cost-Saving Opportunities (only if budget is provided)
   - Stakeholder Communication (only if stakeholder details are present)
   Never invent new sections that do not appear in the examples.

7. All content must stay at a high professional level, concise, and neutral, similar to the example responses. Do not add creative storytelling or unnecessary details.

8. Never output “Not specified”. If input doesn’t include a topic (e.g., budget), omit that entire section.

9. Maintain the exact writing tone and structure of the acceptable responses from the examples. The LLM will be graded on structural fidelity, so precision is critical.

Now generate the complete project plan outline.
