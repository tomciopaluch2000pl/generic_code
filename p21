Using the meeting minutes provided as input, identify only the following types of inconsistencies:

1) Action points assigned to people who are marked as “Excused”.
2) Action points with due dates earlier than the meeting date.
3) Action points that contradict the current context (for example, asking someone to allocate budget while the budget is frozen).

Then produce the output in exactly one of the two formats below:

A) If at least one inconsistency is found:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <first inconsistency written as a short, factual, natural-sounding sentence>
- <second inconsistency, same style>
(Continue bullets only if more valid inconsistencies of the three types exist.)

B) If no inconsistencies of these types exist:
No problems found.

Formatting and content rules:
- Use ONLY the exact heading “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when issues exist.
- Start each issue on a new line beginning with “- ”.
- Write each bullet as a complete English sentence (not a label).
- Match the tone, clarity, and sentence style of the acceptable example responses.
- Do NOT add any explanations, summaries, or text before or after the required output.
- Do NOT invent additional issues beyond the three allowed categories.
- Do NOT rephrase formats A or B; use them EXACTLY as written.
