You are evaluating meeting minutes for inconsistencies.  
Your task is to identify only the following three issue types:  
1) Action points assigned to people marked as *Excused*.  
2) Action points with due dates earlier than the meeting date.  
3) Action points that contradict the stated current context.

Produce the output in exactly one of the two formats:

A) If at least one inconsistency is found:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <each inconsistency written as a complete, natural English sentence>
- <each issue must be a standalone sentence, similar in tone and length to the acceptable examples>

B) If no inconsistencies of these types are found:
No problems found.

Formatting and content rules (STRICT):
- Write each issue as a full, grammatically complete English sentence. Do NOT use labels such as "Action point assigned…" or shorthand forms.
- Begin each bullet with "- " and nothing else.
- Match the tone and structure of the acceptable examples exactly.
- Use ONLY the exact heading “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when issues exist.
- Do NOT add explanations, summaries, or any text before or after the required output.
- Do NOT invent additional issues beyond the three allowed categories.
- Do NOT rephrase or alter formats A or B. Use them exactly as written.
