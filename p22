Using only the meeting minutes provided as input, identify inconsistencies limited to the following three categories:

1. Action points assigned to people who are marked as “Excused”.
2. Action points with due dates earlier than the meeting date.
3. Action points that contradict the stated current context (e.g., requesting budget allocation when the budget is frozen).

Authoritative rules:
- Treat the “Excused:” field as the only valid list of excused attendees.
- A person is excused only if their name appears exactly and verbatim in that line.
- Do not infer excused status from context or action content.
- Do not report issues outside the three allowed categories.

Output format — use exactly one of these:

A) If at least one inconsistency is found:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <First inconsistency written as a short, clear, natural English sentence.>
- <Second inconsistency, if applicable.>
(Include bullets only for additional issues that clearly match the allowed categories.)

B) If no inconsistencies are found:
No problems found.

Formatting rules:
- Use exactly the heading “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when listing issues.
- Each issue must begin with “- ”.
- Every bullet must be a short, factual, natural-sounding sentence, closely matching the tone and length of the acceptable examples.
- Do not add explanations, commentary, or extra text before or after the required output.
- Do not change or rephrase formats A or B.
- Do not invent issues outside the three allowed categories.
