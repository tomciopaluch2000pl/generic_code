BCM / DRP
Legal Archive Hub
1. Purpose and Scope

Purpose
This document describes the Business Continuity Management (BCM) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) for the Legal Archive Hub solution.

Scope
The scope covers:

Application layer

Database layer

Local system configuration

Data persistence and backup

External storage dependencies (HCP)

The document applies to single-instance deployments running on IBM pSeries.

2. System Overview
2.1 Architecture Summary

The Legal Archive Hub is deployed as a single-instance solution without geographical redundancy.

Core components:

Application: IBM CMOD 10.5

Database: IBM DB2 (local instance)

Operating System: AIX

Platform: IBM pSeries (single LPAR)

Archive Storage: Hitachi Vantara HCP (S3 protocol)

2.2 High-Level Architecture Characteristics

Single LPAR per environment

No active-active or active-passive setup

No secondary data center

No automatic failover

Disaster recovery is based on restore procedures, not site switch

3. Business Continuity Management (BCM)
3.1 BCM Strategy

Business Continuity is limited by design.

The Legal Archive Hub does not provide BCM in the classical sense, due to:

Lack of a secondary site

Single-instance architecture

No real-time replication of application or database

BCM approach:
➡️ Recover service on the same site after incident resolution.

3.2 Supported BCM Scenarios
Scenario	BCM Coverage
Application crash	Manual restart
OS-level issue	Manual system recovery
LPAR outage	Requires infrastructure recovery
Site outage	Not supported
3.3 BCM Limitations (Explicit Statement)

The Legal Archive Hub does not support business continuity in the event of a full site outage.
No alternative site or standby infrastructure is available.

This limitation is known, accepted and documented.

4. Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
4.1 DRP Objectives

The DRP focuses on:

Recovering the application environment

Restoring system configuration

Restoring the database

Re-establishing connectivity to archive storage

4.2 Recovery Time Objectives (Indicative)
Component	RTO
OS / LPAR availability	Infrastructure dependent
Application restore	2–4 hours
Database restore	Depends on DB size
Full service recovery	Same business day
4.3 Recovery Point Objectives
Component	RPO
Database	Last successful DB2 backup
Local configuration	Last filesystem backup
Archived data (HCP)	Near-zero (platform managed)
5. Backup Strategy
5.1 Local System Backup

The following local data must be backed up regularly:

CMOD configuration files

Application-specific directories

OS-level configuration (if applicable)

Scripts, certificates, keystores

Backup type:

File system level backup

Scheduled, automated

5.2 Database Backup (DB2)

Full DB2 backups performed regularly

Backup frequency aligned with business requirements

Backups stored outside the LPAR (where possible)

Restore dependency:

DB2 binaries and version compatibility

OS availability

5.3 Archive Data (HCP)

Archived content is NOT backed up at application level.

Important clarification:

All archived data is stored in HCP and benefits from HCP’s internal redundancy, durability and data protection mechanisms.

6. External Dependencies
6.1 Hitachi Content Platform (HCP)

Used as archive storage via S3 protocol

Provides:

Data redundancy

High durability

Internal replication mechanisms

Responsibility model:

HCP availability, redundancy and data protection
➡️ Owned and managed by the Storage Team

Legal Archive Hub relies on HCP as an external service

6.2 Responsibility Split
Area	Responsibility
Application	Application Team
DB2 backups	Application / DB Team
OS / LPAR	Infrastructure Team
HCP platform	Storage Team
7. Disaster Recovery Procedure (High-Level)

Restore OS / LPAR (if required)

Restore filesystem backups (CMOD configuration)

Restore DB2 database from latest backup

Validate application configuration

Start CMOD services

Verify connectivity to HCP

Perform application-level validation

8. Risks and Assumptions
8.1 Key Risks

Single point of failure (single LPAR)

No site-level disaster protection

Recovery dependent on infrastructure availability

8.2 Assumptions

HCP remains available during application recovery

Storage Team ensures HCP durability and redundancy

Backup jobs complete successfully and are monitored

9. Summary (Executive-Friendly)

The Legal Archive Hub is a single-instance archival solution without site redundancy.
Business continuity is limited by architecture; disaster recovery is based on backup and restore procedures.
Archived data is protected by the underlying HCP platform, which is managed by the Storage Team.
