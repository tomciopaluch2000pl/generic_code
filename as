Used Copilot (goto/red) during development of automation scripts for CMOD China and Landing Zone, reducing documentation time and improving code consistency.
	•	Applied AI-assisted analysis to validate log patterns and identify bottlenecks in Storage Protect processes, which accelerated troubleshooting during federation tests.

⸻

✅ 2. Storage Forecasting and Capacity Planning (SME Role)

Przykłady:
	•	Prepared a full storage growth model for APAC/EMEA SP environments and identified early saturation risk for NGIX nodes, enabling timely procurement and preventing outages.
	•	Created a forecast for CMOD China HUB that included compression ratios and deduplication impact, which helped Infra Owners size storage correctly for Production.

⸻

✅ 3. CMOD China HUB

Przykłady:
	•	Developed and successfully executed silent RHEL8 installation scripts for Storage Protect, allowing Infrastructure teams to provision DEV/TE1/TE2 efficiently.
	•	Discovered and fixed retention policy misalignment during DR testing, ensuring China HUB met UBS compliance standards before Production rollout.

⸻

✅ 4. Landing Zone Data Transfer (CS → UBS)

Przykłady:
	•	Delivered Azure vault-based authentication and automated azcopy pipeline that successfully transferred multiple 2–5 TB test feeds from CS to UBS ahead of PoC timeline.
	•	Identified a critical mismatch in feed metadata structure from CS — worked with architects to correct the schema, preventing Production failures.

⸻

✅ 5. LA HUB Federation / Core Transition

Przykłady:
	•	Successfully performed APAC federation connectivity validation with IBM Support by resolving certificate chain issues on NGIX nodes.
	•	Created and documented the new federated backup model which reduced monitoring overhead for both RAR and GERA teams.

⸻

✅ 6. Onboarding and Mentoring of New Software Engineer

Przykłady:
	•	Designed and ran structured KT sessions (Storage Protect architecture, CMOD integration, L3 troubleshooting), enabling the new engineer to take ownership of tickets within 6 weeks.
	•	Guided the engineer through first federation test execution end-to-end, ensuring he gained confidence in handling Production-impacting processes.

⸻

✅ 7. APO for CMOD distributed and z/OS

Przykłady:
	•	Coordinated cross-team activities for BCCH migration wave 1 and 2 to Lazar, ensuring on-time execution despite complex mainframe dependencies.
	•	Led daily stand-ups and created clear priorities for L3 engineers, reducing context switching and improving ticket resolution stability during Q2.

⸻

❗ Teraz Behaviors (krótkie, ale konkretne przykłady):

⸻

✅ 8. Risk Management

Przykłady:
	•	Flagged a potential non-compliant data retention setup during China HUB configuration; escalated early and coordinated correction with Security Engineering.
	•	Ensured full audit readiness by maintaining complete documentation for Landing Zone authentication, certificates and vault integration.

⸻

✅ 9. Behavior – Accountability with Integrity

Przykłady:
	•	Took ownership of the cross-team issue affecting CS → UBS transfer validation by organizing a triage call and delivering a root-cause summary same day.
	•	Stepped up to cover L3 responsibilities during a critical migration weekend even outside standard hours, ensuring stability of CMOD and SP.

⸻

✅ 10. Behavior – Collaboration

Przykłady:
	•	Actively collaborated with architects, Infra, and IBM Support during LA HUB federation, aligning design decisions and removing blockers.
	•	Supported teammates with detailed context on Storage Protect behaviors, enabling them to handle incidents without escalation.
