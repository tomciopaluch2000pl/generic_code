Using the meeting minutes provided as input, identify any inconsistencies. Focus ONLY on the following types of issues:

1) Action points assigned to people who are marked as “Excused”.
2) Action points with due dates that are earlier than the meeting date.
3) Action points that contradict the current context (e.g., asking someone to allocate budget while the budget is frozen).

Then produce the output using exactly ONE of the two formats below:

A) If you find at least one inconsistency:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <first inconsistency in a single, concise sentence>
- <second inconsistency in a single, concise sentence>
(Continue bullets only if there are more clear inconsistencies of the three types above.)

B) If you do NOT find any inconsistencies of these types:
No problems found.

Formatting and content rules:
- Do not add any other headings, explanations, or commentary before or after the answer.
- Use exactly the sentence “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when listing issues.
- Start each issue on a new line with “- ”.
- Keep each bullet short, factual, and businesslike, similar in style and length to the acceptable responses.
- Do NOT invent additional problems beyond the three categories listed above.
- Do NOT rephrase the formats A) or B); use them exactly as specified.
