Using the meeting minutes provided as input, identify any inconsistencies. Focus ONLY on the following three types of issues:

1) Actions assigned to people who are marked as “Excused”.
2) Actions with due dates earlier than the meeting date.
3) Actions that contradict the stated current context in the minutes (for example, asking someone to allocate budget while the budget is frozen).

Then produce the output in EXACTLY one of the two formats below:

A) If at least one inconsistency of the three types exists:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <first inconsistency written as a short, natural, factual English sentence>
- <second inconsistency written as a short, natural, factual English sentence>
(Continue bullet points only if more clear issues of the allowed types exist.)

B) If NONE of the three issue types are present:
No problems found.

STRICT formatting and content rules:
- Use EXACTLY the heading “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when issues exist.
- Start each issue on a new line beginning with “- ” and nothing else.
- Each bullet must be a short, factual, natural-sounding sentence (not a label).
- Match the tone, clarity, and sentence style of the acceptable example responses.
- Do NOT add explanations, summaries, or any extra text before or after the required output.
- Do NOT invent any issues beyond the three allowed categories.
- Do NOT rephrase formats A or B; use them EXACTLY as written.
