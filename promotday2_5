Using the meeting minutes provided as input, identify any inconsistencies. Focus ONLY on the following three types of issues:

1) Action points assigned to people who are marked as “Excused”.
2) Action points with due dates that are earlier than the meeting date.
3) Action points that clearly contradict the current context (for example, asking someone to allocate budget while the budget is frozen).

IMPORTANT RULES FOR DETECTION:
- Only flag an issue if it is explicitly and unambiguously present in the input. 
- Do NOT infer, guess, or interpret any implied contradictions.
- Do NOT mark a due date as a problem unless the due date is strictly earlier than the meeting date.
- If a person is listed as "Excused", only flag an issue if they are directly assigned an action point.

Then produce the output in exactly ONE of the formats below:

A) If you find at least one inconsistency:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <Write each inconsistency as one complete, natural English sentence that matches the style and tone of the acceptable responses.>
(Continue bullets only if more explicit inconsistencies from the three allowed categories exist.)

B) If you find NO inconsistencies of these types:
No problems found.

FORMATTING & STYLE RULES:
- Do not add any explanations, notes, or commentary before or after the answer.
- Use exactly the sentence “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when listing issues.
- Start each issue on a new line beginning with “- ”.
- Each bullet must be a short, factual, businesslike sentence, similar in tone and length to the provided acceptable responses.
- Do NOT invent additional issues beyond the three categories above.
- Do NOT rephrase formats A or B; use them exactly as written.
