SECTION 1 — What should they continue doing?

Vidhya consistently demonstrates strong ownership, reliability, and high-quality delivery across all assigned tasks. She works very independently, always meets her commitments, and proactively removes blockers rather than waiting for others to intervene. Her ability to quickly understand complex systems (Oracle, CMOD, DB2, AIX, RHEL8) makes her a highly valuable team member across multiple streams.

She approaches every task with great attention to detail and precision, ensuring correctness and completeness of the output. Her engagement is exceptional — she is often willing to go the extra mile to ensure successful delivery. She is also always willing to help others, providing meaningful support and adding real value to her colleagues.

Her work ethic, technical breadth, and collaborative attitude are clear strengths that she should continue developing and applying in future projects.

✅ SECTION 2 — What could they do to have more impact?

Given her strong technical expertise and reliability, Vidhya could increase her impact by taking an even more active role in shaping technical decisions. Moving slightly beyond execution into earlier phases of solutioning — such as influencing design choices, proposing technical direction, or initiating discussions around architecture — would amplify her already strong contributions.

This would not only highlight her expertise even more but would also help guide the team earlier in the development lifecycle and reduce rework downstream. She already has the technical foundation to take such steps when the opportunity arises.

✅ SECTION 3 — How have they demonstrated the UBS Behaviors?

(Integrity, Accountability, Collaboration, Innovation)

Accountability with Integrity
Vidhya reliably delivers what she commits to, maintains high-quality standards, and takes full responsibility for her work. She proactively addresses issues and escalates only when needed, always aiming for the best outcome for the project.

Collaboration
She is an excellent team player — always ready to support others, share knowledge, and step in when someone needs help. She interacts with stakeholders respectfully and constructively, demonstrating a strong collaborative spirit across teams and regions.

Innovation
She shows strong initiative and curiosity, often stepping outside her core Oracle expertise. A notable example is the full migration of IDMS to CMOD China Hub, where she quickly learned the data structures, gathered requirements directly from stakeholders (partly taking over BA responsibilities), and successfully delivered the migration. She also quickly absorbed RHEL8 knowledge and implemented a new SSL certification method for CMOD. Her ability to expand her technical range and solve new types of problems is a clear demonstration of innovation.
