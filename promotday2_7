Using the meeting minutes provided as input, identify any inconsistencies. 
Evaluate ONLY the following three types of issues:

1) Action points assigned to people who are marked as “Excused”.
2) Action points with due dates that are earlier than the meeting date.
3) Action points that contradict the current context (for example, asking someone to allocate budget while the budget is frozen).

Authoritative data rules:
- Treat the “Excused:” field as the ONLY valid list of excused attendees. 
- Do NOT assume or infer excused attendees from context or action points.
- A person may be considered excused ONLY if their name appears EXACTLY and VERBATIM in the “Excused:” line.
- Do NOT generate or suggest any excused-status inconsistencies unless they follow the rule above.

Output format (use EXACTLY one of the two):

A) If you find at least one inconsistency:
Potential problems in the meeting minutes:
- <First inconsistency written as a complete, natural English sentence.>
- <Second inconsistency written as a complete, natural English sentence.>
(Continue bullets ONLY if additional issues clearly fall into the three allowed categories.)

B) If you do NOT find any inconsistencies of the allowed types:
No problems found.

Formatting rules:
- Use EXACTLY the heading: “Potential problems in the meeting minutes:” when listing issues.
- Start each issue on a new line beginning with “- ”.
- Each bullet must be a short, factual, natural-sounding sentence, similar in tone and length to the acceptable responses.
- Do NOT add any explanations, commentary, or labels before or after the answer.
- Do NOT invent additional issues beyond the three allowed categories.
- Do NOT rephrase formats A or B; use them EXACTLY as written.
